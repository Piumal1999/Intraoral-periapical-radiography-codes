# Intraoral-periapical-radiography-codes

This repository contains various modules for detecting and analyzing dental structures using PyTorch. It includes implementations for bone line detection, keypoint detection, teeth detection, and tooth detection. Each module is designed to work independently and can be integrated into a larger pipeline for dental image analysis.

## Directory Structure

- **Bone Level Detection**: Contains code and models for detecting the bone level in dental images.
- **Keypoint Detection**: Contains code and models for identifying key points (CEJ, Apex) in dental images.
- **Teeth Detection**: Contains code and models for detecting individual teeth in dental X-rays or images.
- **Tooth Detection**: Focused on detecting single tooth structures in images.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.8+
- torchvision
